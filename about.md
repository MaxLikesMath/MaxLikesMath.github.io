# About

This blog is place where I can put my thoughts, ideas, and small research projects. It's not meant to be the most formal thing in the world, but instead a place for developing ideas and having fun exploring different ways of looking at problems in machine learning, and AI in a more broad sense. Feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, concerns, constructive criticism, etc. We're all here to explore and learn, so we should help each other when we can.

## Who Am I?
Hey, My name is Max Hennick. I am a researcher at [TrojAI](https://troj.ai/). My research interests are group equivariant convolutional neural networks (and applications of other algebraic structures to deep learning), representation learning, and adversarial attacks. I'm also a big fan of computability theory, computational group theory, and reinforcement learning.
